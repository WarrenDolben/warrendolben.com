    <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p id="text">
    &emsp;I grew up on the Seacoast in Portsmouth, NH. I went to a small private university in South Western New York called Alfred University. I majored in English, and minored in Communications. I was also a four year member of the Saxons' swim team. I coached collegiate swimming as an Assistant Coach for several years; first at King's College in Wilkes-Barre, PA, then at Washington College in Chestertown, MD. I am enjoying learning the intricacies of new technologies, and feel that my attention to detail, and desire to hone my craft, will well serve clients' needs. <br>
  &emsp;I've been on this learning journey four the past three years now. I first started this site in 2017, and just the other day (1.26.21), I managed to make this site live on the web! It's amazing what a little persistence can do. Also, I'm exceedingly glad that I kept this via GitHub because this is a timeless gem. Ok, maybe I shouldn't go that far, but it's a nice reminder of how far I've come, and also how long I've been at it!<br>
  &emsp;It's truly amazing to look at this group of documents, and all the crazy antiquated ways I was doing things. For intstance, doing something weird with my tabbing (styling it in CSS), and also importing fonts in a longwinded fashion. It's no wonder that a recruiter once told me that my website looked "outdated," in reference to my work on my friend Nick's site. I've since made a better version, but have yet to send it over to him. Anyway, the point is I've come a long way since then, and I'm excited to keep experimenting with new technologies here, and continue to make this site better!<br>
  &emsp;My blog will be expiring at the end of the month, and I may be migrating content from there to here; which is probably what I will do eventually either way. Thanks for stopping by, and take a look before everything is updated and contemporary.</p>
